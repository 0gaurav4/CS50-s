<b>Specifications</b>

1. The website should have three pages: Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search.
2. On the Google Search page, there should be links in the upper-right to go to Image Search or Advanced Search. On the other two pages, there should be a link to go back to Google Search.
3. The Google Search page should have a centered search bar with rounded corners. The search button should be centered below the search bar.
4. On the Google Search page, users should be able to type a query, click "Google Search," and be taken to the search results.
5. On the Google Image Search page, users should be able to type a query, click a search button, and be taken to the image search results.
6. On the Google Advanced Search page, users should be able to provide input for four fields: "all these words," "this exact word or phrase," "any of these words," and "none of these words."
7. The Advanced Search page should have the four options stacked vertically, with left-aligned text fields.
8. The "Advanced Search" button should be blue with white text. Clicking it should take the user to the search results page for their query.
9. Add an "I'm Feeling Lucky" button on the main Google Search page. Clicking it should take the user directly to the first search result, bypassing the normal results page.
10. The CSS should match Google's aesthetics as closely as possible.
